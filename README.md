Distributed Lecturing and Examination System

As we continue on completing our academic studies with relation to IT we tend to seek for methods which can make life more convenient and smooth. Because of that eventually we are driven to seek innovative methods to make our higher studies a convenient one. Since modern days most of our students are equipped with internet, laptops, web cams and various inventions thanks to the technology, we thought about compiling these inventions to create a virtual environment which could be helpful to create a new era of comfortable learning culture. The bloom of the concept "Distributed Lecturing and Examination System" was coupled up with the existing concepts like virtual class room, e-learning, educational networking and e-safe examination systems.

The concept of Virtual classroom and Educational networking systems, not been a stranger for the international market has been occupied to various cultures of learning among the world due to the convenience it provides to the education system. As a matter of fact the challenge for us is to create a system which has all the existing features in a more advanced manner and its own unique features as well. The core objective of this project is to inspire students a new perception of a learning culture which is more convenient to them in engaging day to day learning activities without facing any hazard involved in learning by traveling to a certain destination, wasting time and travel cost which are involved in current educational system.
